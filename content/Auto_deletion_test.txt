This file is going to be uploaded from branch volik-fedir, that is not
present on the repository, via command git push -u origin volik-fedir.
After that, a pull request will be created, hopefully, quickly reviewed,
and then the changes will be merged. That should cause a newly created on
the github repo branch "volik-fedir" to be deleted. If it is so, the
repository is configured successfully.

I know I promised a piece of poetry. I am a terrible liar.
